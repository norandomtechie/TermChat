# TermChat

## Introduction
TermChat is a fast, end-to-end encrypted, lightweight, messenger written in Python that enables untraceable conversations between users.

## Progress
The implementation, as of the last commit, is not a usable script. Work is being performed on actually getting messages from other users. As of now, the script only saves message history for users in AES-256 encrypted files, and displays them on being opened.
